Just a sample project to test PackedSceneGLTF

How to use it
-------------

Drop a GLB file into the scene.  
See if it loads correctly.

So far, issues can happen when using the HTML
version.  
The Desktop version always work, though.

This requires Godot 3.4beta with @you-win patches to export PackedSceneGLTF

And Lyuma patches for the shader
